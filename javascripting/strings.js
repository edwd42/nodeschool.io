 ## STRINGS (Exercise 3 of 19)  
   
  A string is a sequence of characters. A character is, roughly speaking, a  
  written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers, punctuation  
  marks, and spaces.  
   
  String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.  
   
     'this is a string'  
       
     "this is also a string"  
   
 ## NOTE  
   
  Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotation  
  marks.  
   
 ## The challenge:  
   
  For this challenge, create a file named strings.js.  
   
  In that file create a variable named someString like this:  
   
     var someString = 'this is a string';  
   
  Use console.log to print the variable someString to the terminal.  
   
  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:  
   
  javascripting verify strings.js
